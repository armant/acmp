My solutions for the problems at acmp.ru (Russian Project Euler) that I made during high school. The topics covered include analytical geometry, dynamic programming, arbitrary-precision arithmetic, greedy algorithms, combinatorics, graph theory, mathematical modeling, string operations, recursion, sorting and sequences, and data structures.
